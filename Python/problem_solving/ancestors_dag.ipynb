    "# üß© **LeetCode Problem 2192: All Ancestors of a Node in a Directed Acyclic Graph**\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ **Problem Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n-1`, you are required to return a list of all ancestors for each node in the graph. The graph is represented as a list of edges where each edge is a pair `[u, v]` indicating that there is a directed edge from node `u` to node `v`.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **ancestor** of a node `v` is defined as any node `u` for which there is a path directed from `u` to `v`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìù **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**: \n",
    "  - `n = 8`\n",
    "  - `edges = [[0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 3], [2, 4], [2, 7], [3, 5], [3, 6], [3, 7], [4, 6]]`\n",
    "- **Output**: \n",
    "  - `[[], [], [], [0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 1, 3], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input**: \n",
    "  - `n = 5`\n",
    "  - `edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 4]]`\n",
    "- **Output**: \n",
    "  - `[[], [0], [0], [0, 1], [0, 2]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß **Constraints**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1 <= n <= 1000`\n",
    "- `0 <= edges.length <= 1000`\n",
    "- `0 <= u, v < n`\n",
    "- `u != v`\n",
    "- All pairs `[u, v]` are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí° **Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, the following steps are taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Representation**:\n",
    "   - The graph is represented using an adjacency list where each node points to its parent nodes. This inversion of edges helps in tracking ancestors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Finding Ancestors**:\n",
    "   - A recursive function is defined to traverse the graph and collect all ancestors of a given node.\n",
    "   - For each node, a set for visited nodes and a set for ancestors are initialized.\n",
    "   - The recursive function traverses the graph, adding ancestors of the current node to the ancestor set.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sorting**:\n",
    "   - After collecting the ancestors, the set of ancestors for each node is converted to a sorted list to ensure the ancestors are listed in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "### üîç **Example Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "For the input `n = 8`, `edges = [[0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 3], [2, 4], [2, 7], [3, 5], [3, 6], [3, 7], [4, 6]]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Node `0` has no ancestors.\n",
    "- Node `1` has no ancestors.\n",
    "- Node `2` has no ancestors.\n",
    "- Node `3` has ancestors `[0, 1]`.\n",
    "- Node `4` has ancestors `[0, 2]`.\n",
    "- Node `5` has ancestors `[0, 1, 3]`.\n",
    "- Node `6` has ancestors `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.\n",
    "- Node `7` has ancestors `[2, 3]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "For the input `n = 5`, `edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 4]]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Node `0` has no ancestors.\n",
    "- Node `1` has ancestors `[0]`.\n",
    "- Node `2` has ancestors `[0]`.\n",
    "- Node `3` has ancestors `[0, 1]`.\n",
    "- Node `4` has ancestors `[0, 2]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéâ **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem involves identifying all ancestors for each node in a Directed Acyclic Graph. By representing the graph using an adjacency list and using a recursive approach to find ancestors, we can efficiently solve this problem. The final list of ancestors is sorted to meet the problem's requirements.\n",
